# TTC-extraction-from-receipt-images-with-deep-learning

## About the project 

In this notebook i trained a FASTER-RCNN on CORD : A Consolidated Receipt Dataset for Post-OCR Parsing
to extract the region of total amount of TTC and then extract the vaules with pytesseract

##Usage

1. Download the dataset from [https://github.com/clovaai/cord](https://github.com/clovaai/cord) 
2. Upload the dataset to your personal drive under the folder **CORD**
3. Open the notebook in google colab
